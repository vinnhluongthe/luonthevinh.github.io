      The first European and American arrivals in Yokohama were required by the shogun to live within a gated settlement in Kannai, where the city’s baseball stadium stands today. But over time they were permitted to build new homes in the most sought-after parts of the city.

      Wealthy businessmen and traders soon began to congregate their homes on a rise directly to the south of the community, known as The Bluff, giving them views over the port and the benefit of cool sea breezes during the hot and humid summer months. And while the view has changed immeasurably in the last 150 years, some of these properties remain.

  The early decades of the last century were marked by rapid economic growth across Yokohama, but that came to an abrupt halt on September 1, 1923, when the magnitude 7.9 Great Kanto Earthquake rattled eastern Japan.

  The tremor caused widespread damage and much loss of life, with many of the victims buried in the Yokohama Foreign General Cemetery, which slopes down from the top of The Bluff.
  
  A single headstone bears the names of 10 priests who all died on the day of the disaster. Another marker nearby has the names of half-a-dozen Catholic sisters. Leonardus Van Der Polder, who was born in Rotterdam in 1851, is buried here alongside his wife, Annie, yet more victims of the tragedy.
  
  Other older tombstones also bear the scars of the quake, with many cracked and cemented back together after collapsing in the violent tremors.
  
  A stroll through more than 4,200 grave markers is a fascinating walk through history. Renowned war correspondent Dixie Tighe, of the New York Post, is buried here after dying in Tokyo in 1946, close to British engineer Edmund Morel, who constructed the first railway line from Yokohama to Shimbashi, but died only one year after arriving in Japan in 1870.
  
  Beneath a tree is a bust and gravestone of Hermann Grauert, who built the Catholic cathedral and survived an attempt on his life by a samurai disgruntled at growing foreign influences in Japan.

	A couple of miles to the southwest is Negishi Forest Park, dominated by the towering grandstand of the former Nippon Race Club.

The grandstand is all that remains of Japan’s first Western-style horse racing track, which was in its pomp in the 1930s.

Panels to the rear of the stand show it in its heyday, with lounges overlooking the track, the judges’ stand and betting booths. Emperor Hirohito (1901-1989) was apparently a fan of the races and visited on several occasions.

In the years after Japan’s defeat in World War II, the entire racecourse was taken over by the occupation authorities and served as a military base. The park was returned to the city of Yokohama in the 1970s and is famous for its cherry blossoms in the spring, while the Equine Museum of Museum tells the story of horse racing in Japan.
